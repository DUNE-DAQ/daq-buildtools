# daq-buildtools

A collection of documentation, scripts and CMake modules designed to
make it as easy as possible for developers to create new packages and
control their builds.

Excerpted from a May 19th, 2020 email from Giovanna, prior to
development:

"[daq-buildtools] will contain:

- One or more CMake modules defining common functions and macros that
  other packages will use in their CMakeLists.txt file

- A set of scripts facilitating the setting up of the environment for
  developing and running, the downloading/building of a release

- Encapsulating the handling of all external packages

- Containing a template for CMakeLists.txt

- Utilities such as “create_new_package.sh <name>” "
